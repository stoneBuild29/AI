# RAGFlow Local Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying RAGFlow locally, including integrating a base model and connecting Ollama.

## Overview
RAGFlow is an open-source project designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It supports local deployment for better customization and privacy.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **System Requirements**:
   - Sufficient disk space (for models and data).
   - Docker installed (recommended).
2. **Basic Tools**:
   - Git
   - Node.js (for running scripts)
   - Python (for backend tasks)

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the RAGFlow repository
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow
```

### 2. Docker Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run Docker container
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Base Model Integration
1. Start with a minimal base model.
2. Follow the instructions in the project’s documentation to load the model.

### 4. User Interface Access
- Once the UI is accessible, ensure that it’s working correctly.

### 5. Connect Ollama for Large Model Support
- After verifying the UI, integrate Ollama for extended model capabilities.

---

## Additional Features: Authentication (Future Task)
- Authentication is planned for later stages.
- Ensure model security and controlled access by setting up user management features.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue exploring available modules.
- Customize the deployment to fit specific use cases.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Docker Issues**: Ensure Docker service is running.
- **UI Not Accessible**: Check logs for frontend/backend errors.
- **Model Loading Errors**: Verify the correct model paths and configurations.
