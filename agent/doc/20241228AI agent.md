- **Agent = LLM + Planning + Feedback + Tool use。**

  An “Intelligent Agent architecture” refers to the design or structure of an autonomous agent, which is a system or entity capable of independently perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals.
- Architecture of intelligent agent in ai consist of four key components:

  the profiling module, memory module, planning module, and action module, each serving a distinct purpose in shaping the agent’s behavior.

  The ***profiling module*** identifies the agent’s role with various methods such as handcrafting, LLM generation, and dataset alignment.

  The *memory module* emulates human memory processes and offers structures and formats for storing information.

  The ***planning module*** allows agents to strategize for complex tasks, both with and without feedback, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities.

  Finally, the ***action module*** translates decisions into outcomes, with targets, strategies, action spaces, and influences playing critical roles.
