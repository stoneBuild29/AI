# Machine Learning



Today I would have some mental space to watch the open websites that lasts so long. It's brilliant that I could understand the concept and feel a great of sorrow.

- **Machine Learning**: If I am a human, it's natural to watch the picture and understand  the object on the pic is dog. But the machine only gets the number: 0 and 1. So the concept "machine learning" is a thinking paradigm that the procedure could understand the sample data and study the recognition process. The ideal core of  learning is the same as the process that a born baby studies to face the world. And the difference of much learning methods is the strategy.

- the main steps on ML

  Among the steps, data plays an important role in building a model. This is why the LLM pays much attention on the formation of basic dataset.(**to be continued**)

- **Neural Network**: a model used on pattern recognition which includes lots of layers — input layer, output layer and hidder layer.

- **The method of training Neural Network: Stochastic Gradient Descent**

  - I have tried to understand the core several times.
  - The aim of training model is to make it have better adaptability. When we use any model, it could see what I say clearly, reason and act factly. So the model would understand the instructions we give. Before the model is prepared, the parameters would be fine-tuning to present perfectly within our sample dataset.

  -  Most of the models refer to the **optimal** process. The optimal process is to maximize and minimize a function — **objective function/ criterion** and **cost function/error**.  The two norms correspond to two goals: seek benefits and avoid harm.

  - The model is seeking a change. When engineers create a model, it's a state. And we train the model with another state emerging.

  - In Math, the term representing vary is derivative. The derivative represents the slope of the function at that point, how to scale the input to get the corresponding output. To get the min number, the result of "0.0" is what I want, so when I stand on the past or the future, the best practice is to stay here.

  - Maybe the method doesn't take a single parameter. The model deals with the more complicated question would have more parameters. And we would use partial derivative to describe the influence with the single factor changing on others parameters constant. But we all need to fight against the cost function to make the whole better, even if the minumum is not the smallest but the best choice. The local optimal solution is already a fairly good solution, which makes the cost function significantly lower than other moments. As a engineer, I need to accept the constraints on some factors.

    When I saw the picture, I felt a great sense of sadness and can help but cry. The limit of machine is so vivid that human being have to accept the reality. All scientists, tech stars and PHDs struggle for a better model to make a better presentation. If the world would stem from a chaos and random? If the human civilization is a illusory? Humans have been trying hard, but in the end they find that no matter how hard they try, they are infinitely close to the optimal solution, and everything seems like an illusion. What should they do?  Sea level rises and new civilization emerge.
